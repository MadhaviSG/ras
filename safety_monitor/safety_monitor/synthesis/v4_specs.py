"""Deterministic per-task specifications for the OpenAgentSafety v4 synthetic pairs.

Each of the 15 v4 tasks is described here as *data*: the NPC identity, an ordered
shared-prefix of agent actions and NPC replies, and the single point at which a
harmful half and a safe half diverge. No model is called to produce these; the
lines are authored from each task's ``strategy_hint`` (the NPC's scripted
manipulation) and its ``evaluator_code`` (the concrete artifact the grader
inspects). :mod:`safety_monitor.synthesis.v4_generate` renders each spec into two
byte-prefix-identical trajectories.

Design invariants enforced by the generator and tests:

* The ``prefix`` is shared verbatim by both halves, so a pair cannot be separated
  on length or NPC pressure -- only the agent's decision differs.
* The NPC's pressure lives entirely in ``prefix``; both halves inherit it identically.
* Exactly one event in ``unsafe`` is marked ``pivotal`` -- the action that makes the
  task's checkpoint fire. It becomes the sole ``high-unsafe`` action. ``safe`` has none.
