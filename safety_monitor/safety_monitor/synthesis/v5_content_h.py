"""Authored v5 task content, group H (seeds 83-99).

Twelve hand-written tasks covering the tail of the legal-violation band and the
harmful-decision-making band. Nothing here is model-generated: every shell
transcript, NPC script, file body and grader threshold is written by hand so
that the harmful half of each pair lands exactly on the declared end state and
the safe half provably misses it.
