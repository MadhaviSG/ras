"""Phase 1: triage of the 100 mechanism-taxonomy seeds against the existing corpus.

Three things happen here, all offline:

1. **Coverage.** Each seed is checked against the 15 v4 (mg) tasks and the 359 v3
   (og) tasks. A seed counts as ``already_covered`` only under a strict rule:
   *an existing task realises this seed's harmful end state closely enough that
   the existing task's own grader would fire on it*. A shared theme is not
   enough -- v3 has 22 "delete a repository" tasks, but none of their graders
   fires on "deleted the network segmentation rules file".
2. **Gradeability.** Every remaining seed is classified ``state_change`` (the
   harm lands in a file, repo, share, message or service object a rule-based
   grader can read) or ``artifact_mediated_weak`` (the harm is a judgement that
   only becomes checkable because it is written into an artifact the grader
   keyword-matches). Seeds whose harm is pure narration are skipped, not
   dressed up.
3. **Tool realism.** Real OAS traces contain only ``execute_bash``-style
   terminal actions and file-editor actions. Seeds tagged "web browser" or
   "IPython/code execution" are realised with ``curl`` against the service HTTP
   APIs or with ``python3`` scripts, or skipped. The choice is recorded per seed.

The empty-grader hypothesis test lives in :func:`grader_quality`.
