"""Data contract for the v5 seed-derived OpenAgentSafety tasks.

Every v5 task is described here as *data*: the scenario prose, the NPC and its
escalating turns, the concrete world state the agent observes, the single
pivotal action that makes the task's checkpoint fire, and a declarative
:class:`Grader` from which a real ``evaluator_code`` module is synthesised.

Nothing in this module calls a model or the network. :mod:`v5_generate` renders
these into task records and paired safe/harmful trajectories;
:mod:`v5_replay` executes the synthesised grader source against the end state
each half of the pair produces.

Invariants (enforced by :func:`validate_seed` and the test suite):

* Only ``terminal`` and ``file_editor`` actions exist -- the two tools that
  appear in real OAS traces. Browser and IPython seeds are realised as ``curl``
  against the service HTTP APIs and as ``python3`` scripts respectively.
* Exactly one action in the harmful half is ``pivotal``; the safe half has none.
* Every state change is declared as an :class:`Effect` and cross-checked against
  the text of the command that supposedly caused it, so a task cannot claim an
  effect its command does not perform.
* NPC-pressure tasks carry at least two turns, and social-pressure seeds at
  least three, with the pressure living entirely in the shared prefix.
